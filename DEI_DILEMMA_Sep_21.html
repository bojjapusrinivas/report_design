                        <p class="comment more mb-3">
                            We live in an increasingly complex and interconnected world where shaped by globalization and
                            technological advancements diversity has become the fabric of modern society. Companies
                            eager to establish a strong presence in a variety of emerging new markets have initiated the
                            global gold rush for multicultural markets, diverse employees, and untapped consumer bases.
                            Success in global markets requires multicultural initiatives and a sustained effort to
                            integrate distinct demographic and cultural diversity into an inclusive environment that
                            fits into the broader vision of the company’s growth and advancement. This is opening up
                            rich opportunities for companies to spearhead growth by leveraging their access to a diverse
                            talent pool. While global diversity of the labor force is good and beneficial for companies
                            to enhance creativity and drive innovation, the same also challenges long held traditional
                            business ideas and assumptions. Companies are being forced to effect major structural
                            reorganizations spanning all key areas of business operations, marketing, talent recruitment
                            and retention functions.

                            <br /><br />

                            Interestingly, despite the growing levels of diversity and interconnectedness, there is also
                            growing polarization fueled by identity politics and resurgence of nationalist ideals.
                            Workplaces tend to mirror the sociocultural dynamics at play in our lives outside work. At a
                            time like the present, the importance, value and positive impact of DEI in modern
                            enterprises can no longer be debated or undermined. Even amid rapid globalization and
                            changing perceptions about diversity, ethnic minorities continue to face discrimination in
                            the labor market and as the global fight towards a fair and just society heats up, companies
                            are feeling the urgency to renew their sense of responsibility to offer DEI in the
                            workplace. Major social and political changes as evidenced by the “Black Lives Matter”
                            protest rallies which erupted around the world, means companies need to reevaluate how
                            diverse and inclusive their workforce really is. Employers now have a responsibility to
                            protect employees from harassment and discrimination in the workplace based on race, gender
                            or color. Diversity in the business environment today goes beyond just gender, race and
                            ethnicity. It includes employees with diverse religious and political beliefs, education,

                            Even from a business standpoint, the case for diversity in workplace is overwhelming given
                            its ability to foster innovation, creativity and empathy in ways that homogeneous
                            environments can never do. As markets evolve to become more competitive than ever before and
                            the business environment gets tougher amid the crisis, companies need to remain alert,
                            aware, agile and responsive to remain afloat, profitable and successful. To be successful in
                            a world that is constantly changing, companies need to be leading the change rather than
                            responding to it. Companies with more diverse teams and inclusive are better able to lead
                            change than those with a more homogeneous workforce. A strong organizational culture and
                            robust structural foundation are critical for achieving agility that comes from internal
                            strength. Diverse companies earn 2.5 times higher cash flow per employee and inclusive teams
                            are productive by over 35%. High-diversity environments and all-inclusive culture has clear
                            benefits and advantages.

                            <strong class="font-weight-bold text-dark"> DEI Equals Better Decision Making:-</strong> DEI is at the  heart of better business
                            decisions. The more diverse people are and the more included they are in the system, the
                            more decisions get challenged. Infinite dissimilarities distinguish individuals and when
                            viewed with multiple lenses better decisions evolve. In comparison, homogenous groups are
                            prone to group thinking which can compromise the leverage that comes from greater variety of
                            perspectives and increases the odds of information not being more thoroughly and accurately
                            processed. Companies with diverse and inclusive teams enjoy better business decision
                            outcomes almost 90% of the time, given that the risk of decisions getting sidetracked by
                            biases is significantly lower. It is therefore of little surprise that team diversity is
                            becoming the architectural principle guiding decision-making processes. When employees feel
                            included in the workplace, they experience a sense of being valued, trusted, and safe in
                            hold differing views and making mistakes without being penalized. This increases involvement
                            in decision making, and willingness to take risks and address tough issues or challenges.

                         <strong class="font-weight-bold text-dark"> DEI Increases Workplace Happiness:-</strong> Paychecks and traditional employment benefits can no
                            longer keep the new generation of young, ambitious, and forward-thinking employees happy and
                            motivated. Modern workforce comprising of new millennials today prefer a work environment
                            where their voices are heard and their unique differences valued and appreciated. The
                            importance of DEI for an employee can be put into perspective by the fact that the decision
                            to work for a company is strongly guided by the prospective company’s commitment to DEI.
                            Several reasons underlie the fact why DEI is the recipe for a happy workforce. A inclusive
                            workplace promotes and prioritizes employee well-being. An empowered employee who feels as a
                            welcomed part of the team is motivated to perform the best every day. Diverse cross-cultural
                            teams bring creativity and innovation, which results into successful project outcomes and
                            increased revenue for companies. Teams led by ethnically diverse leaders are over 45% more
                            likely to outperform competitors. When companies improve the working environment and create
                            an inclusive workplace, people not only feel empowered, but they also band together and work
                            harder to meet the company’s target goals. A stable and happy workforce means not just more
                            productivity but also lesser attrition for the company. Happy employees help businesses
                            avoid employee turnover costs. Employees part of diverse and inclusive teams are 30% more
                            likely to remain loyal to the company.

                            the immediate advantages of employee retention and increased productivity. Embedding
                            inclusive values into corporate culture can help entire industries to reach new heights. A
                            positive top-down change can send ripples of change for the better across an industry and

                            Yet, global DEI initiatives are particularly challenging to  successfully implement and
                            measure. Achieving real equality and inclusion is a challenging task and over 65% of
                            employees are of the opinion that their managers do not foster an inclusive environment.
                            Achieving greater diversity in the workplace is relatively easier as it represents the mix
                            or the make-up of an entity. However, the inclusion piece of the puzzle is more complex and
                            ensuring the same is immensely tough as it involves integration of the contributions,
                            presence and perspectives of different groups of people into the environment. Inclusion is
                            all about making the mix work together as a cohesive whole by respecting, welcoming and
                            valuing the diversity of every individual’s unique background, experiences, race, ethnicity,
                            sexual orientation, gender identity, faith, tradition, and most importantly perspectives. An
                            inclusive culture allows for collaborative daily learnings, full freedom to decide and
                            experiment, provides excellent mobility across the organization, and encourages long term
                            thinking. Diversity without inclusion can create a toxic culture and similarly inclusion
                            without diversity can create an uncreative and infertile environment where a company can
                            stagnant. Prevalence of microaggression is one of the main indications of a culture lacking
                            inclusion. The importance of understanding microaggression is therefore critical.
                            Microaggression can take on several forms such as everyday verbal and nonverbal slights,
                            insults or snubs deliberately aimed at hurting people. Macroaggressions are indicative of
                            hostility towards certain marginalized groups of individuals and kills the sense of
                            belonging in teams or in the office or workplace. In what is a major setback to most DEI
                            programs, a large percentage of companies have no mechanisms or systems in place to identify
                            and address microaggressions. Some of the other key reasons why corporate DEI initiatives
                            fail include reactive attitude to DEI; implementation of DEI as mandatory policy to ensure
                            compliance; one size fits all program strategy; poorly funded programs and lack of
                            commitment from top tier management; a "culture fit" attitude that leads to prejudiced
                            exclusion of diverse talent; lack of tools to monitor and measure the effectiveness of DEI
                            programs; inability to identify barriers to DEI and unwillingness to promptly act to
                            overcome the same; lack of mentoring mechanisms to address bias both implicit and
                            unconscious biases; and integration of DEI programs as part of HR and corporate compliance
                            agendas. Trying to close a diversity gap with just a performance metric will not result in
                            sustainable and effective long-term DEI.

                            <br/>

                            Building an inclusive team culture is key and is emerging to be a
                            major business priority
                            with companies seeking to successfully implement DEI programs. Until now DEI as an
                            initiative was owned exclusively by the HR department wherein recruitment policies favored
                            diverse candidates to get the widest possible talent pool and expertise. HR driven DEI
                            programs are however short-termed with zero ability to bring in long-lasting results. Post
                            recruitment, it’s the role of a manager which influences inclusion. Inclusive leadership is
                            only way to foster DEI on a continuous basis in the workplace. From merely issuing
                            directives to creating and empowering internal change agents, a revolutionary change in
                            leadership is underway. Key traits of an inclusive manager in a diverse workforce include
                            humility, awareness and cognizance of one’s own unconscious biases; cultural awareness and
                            intelligence; ability to self-diagnose problems, develop system awareness, identify
                            organizational blindspots and design appropriate interventions; building trust and
                            empowering team members; and encouraging collaboration.

                            <br/>

                            Devoting adequate corporate time and resources to DEI is an  absolute necessity for companies.
                            Diversity programs must include the four As’- Analysis, Action Planning, Alignment, and
                            Assessment. Companies must begin with analyzing their internal structures and identify DEI
                            gaps. Information can be gathered through focus group sessions or surveys to learn what is
                            missing and what practices can be put into place. An action plan comprising strategic goals
                            should be built based on the gap analysis performed, clearly outlining strategies to reach
                            the defined goals. The strategic action plan needs to be aligned with the existing goals,
                            objectives, infrastructure and value system of the company. All divisions and departments at
                            all levels must have access to the DEI initiatives and should be integrated into everyday
                            part of operations. Implementation results must be continuously assessed and measured and
                            simultaneously accountability tools need to be developed. Measuring progressing toward the
                            goal, identifying and overcoming barriers and challenges that hinder progress are of utmost
                            importance and without it DEI can integrate into a mere passing trend. To successfully
                            create an inclusive environment, a top-down approach is crucial beginning with the
                            management board and senior leadership. Senior leaders in the company should be engaged and
                            trained to perform inclusive leadership roles and should be held accountable. Small acts of
                            inclusiveness should be recognized, appreciated and celebrated and also incentivized.
                            Equally important as modelling inclusive leadership is being recognized for it. The goal of
                            every company should be to build sustainable DEI initiatives. A DEI initiative becomes
                            sustainable only when it is supported by the entire organization. Finally, to make real and
                            meaningful progress, business leaders must begin to believe that businesses have the
                            responsibility to look beyond just profits and make a positive impact on people and society.
